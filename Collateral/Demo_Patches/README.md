Axoloti Control Demo Patches 


If you compile these 3 onto your SD card, set to load 1 automatically, you should be able to switch between the patches by pushing one of the tiny buttons on the back of the board. 

These are super rough but might be useful for someone. I think 1.axp requires the audio files from a Radio Music module SD card to work.
